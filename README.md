Description
The aim of this project was to develop an application for the Universal Windows Platform. I chose a Unity game as any kind of Unity project can be run on UWP devices.

Program
The game consists of 3 levels and a tutorial. It has mechanics such as jumping, moving platforms and wall-jumping. The aim of the game is see how fast you can complete a level. The players best times will be stored so they don't need to record it manually. At the moment, the levels are quite short but I intend to update this game with longer levels and more content in the future.

Design
The program was designed using completely free software and assets. I made many of the assets myself using free software such as Paint.net and Audacity. All the software I used was completely free and I didn't have to pay for anything.

I worked on my project over about a month and used GitHubs kanban's boards feature to keep myself organized. It can be found here.

I was very impressed with the Unity engine and it's capabilities. It is intuitive and easy to add new features, design new levels and implement your ideas.

How to run the program
The program can be run by simply downloading/cloning this repository and running the UnityZephyr.exe file found in the repository.
